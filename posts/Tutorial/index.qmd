To develop a draft of a blog post you can add the `draft: true` tag to the yaml header. This will prevent the post from being published to the site.


You can add local images to the blog by:
![Hamiltonian NN](HNN.png){ width=50% }

You can add links to other sites by:
[Homepage](https://webpublishing.oit.ncsu.edu/nail/) 

To add python code to the site, you will need an environment with the packages installed, then you can specify `jupyter: python3` in the qmd yaml . 

Then, you can add python code to the blog by:

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

You can later refer to the figure by @fig-polar


You can write in latex by:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n a_i=0 $$
You can even use it inline like this $a_i \in \mathbb{R} \forall i$.


This works for multiline complex equations as well
$$
    \mathbb{1}_{\mathbb{Q}}(x)=\lim_{k \to \infty}\left(\lim_{j \to \infty}(\cos(k!\pi{x}))^{2j}\right)=\begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if}\; x \in \mathbb{Q}\\
    0 & \text{if}\; x \notin \mathbb{Q}
    \end{cases}
$$

You can also add citations to the blog post by @noauthor_quarto_nodate. This will be automatically added to the bibliography.

Finally you can update the site by using `quarto render` and then `quarto publish gh-pages` to publish the site to github pages.
